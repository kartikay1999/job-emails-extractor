 Hello Kartikay,Thank you for submitting your application to join Upwork. As we do with everyone who wishes to join Upwork, we carefully reviewed your profile to determine whether there is sufficient need for your skills and experience in the marketplace. Unfortunately, at this time there are already many freelancers with a similar skillset to yours and we cannot accept your application. I know this news is likely disappointing to you. However, we want to make sure the freelancers we accept have the best chance at success on our platform. This requires us to not only closely review a freelancerE28099s talents and experience, but also balance those with the availability of projects. For example, at times our marketplace may have too many freelancers with similar skills competing for the number of projects that are available. To avoid the frustration that goes along with that, we must limit the number of new freelancers that can join our website. While you cannot submit proposals for jobs right now, the number of available jobs and freelancers vary throughout the year. We can offer a few suggestions for going forward:  If you have more relevant skills or experience to add now or in the future as you develop them, you can update and re-submit your application and weE28099ll take another look to see if there is a demand for your new skills. If you havenE28099t already, you can learn more about building a complete profile by checking out the following articles:
